# My Tester's Portfolio
# About me
My name is Katarzyna Dargacz, I'm always happy to engage in new projects. Currently, I'm working at Gemini.pl in which I had occasion to practice manual testing of new functionality (creating test cases, performing tests, reporting bugs). My goal is to develop testing knowledge and technical skills. That's why I signed up for a Software Tester course at Software Development Academy, which I completed with my own project. In the past I used to work at Amazon.co.uk as a Team Leader in which I had opportunity to take part in the implementation, testing and reporting of defects in the SmartPack project - an automatic packaging machine.
